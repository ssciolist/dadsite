    <h1>Last Page of the Book Chronicles by Mike Arellano</h1>
    <p>I am not sure if it is fate or destiny but the things and people that have changed my life often found me when I was not looking for them.  Every single person has a hero in them, a person who is capable of extraordinary courage, strength, and wisdom.  The two links that are attached are my first hand look at the remarkable people, places, and times that have been part of my life.  I hope heroes and heroic things look different to you after you read some of these stories.  I hope you see yourself in these stories.  All of the stories are true.</p>
